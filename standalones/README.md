# Standalone samples
Within this folder are standalone samples; meaning the CSS is self contained. 

I know in real projects one should separate out the CSS and JS files
dedicated locations. However, for learning and rapid practice, I will be
creating these 'standalone' samples. These are suppose to hold all necessary
assests for viewing.

**NOTE**: this is not entirely true. Many of these example will reference images. 
However, theses image should be able to be found in the 'svg_images' or 'images' 
folder. 


## Checked IN: 


* `flexbox_nav_rows_2cells.html`: In this example, I used flexbox for the navigation
bar and the content. I know that flexbox should not be used for website layout. 
Rememeber these are learning attempts. Each row will be split in a single column 
for mobile and I have some other media queries for large desktop monitors.
